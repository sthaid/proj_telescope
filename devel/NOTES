TODO
==================================

buy 
- large washers for stand
- screws and spacers for motor mount
     https://www.mouser.com/Electromechanical/Hardware/Standoffs-Spacers/_/N-aictf?P=1yzug7w
- drills for larger taps

order polulu
- nema23 stepper
- controller
- bracket

camera
- study how to do this

stand
- fix leg
- reverse the mounting bracket, and use larger washers
- take off telescope and use equivalent weight instead,
  attach with zip ties or C clamp

motor drive
- purchase one nema23 from pololu and controller
- test with use linux pc, then raspberry pi
- attach the pulley to 0.75 inch shaft
- attach the motor to the aluminum, probably use tapped holes 

telescope
- want to attach a camera, need to investigate this
- buy the new lense and camera, and test in the basement

Belt  buying HDT-3m-381

==================================
CONTROLL PROGRAM DESIGN
==================================

Sky Chart 
- on upper half of screen,  az/el orientation
- pan and zoom controls
- init from 
  - hygdata.csv
  - planets from thesyklive.com
  - others from more.csv,   such as Pleiades
- display box for actual and desired telescope position
- method to set position from the pane, such as click on desired position and commit

Control Pane
- controls
  - select RA and DEC
     - from sky chart
     - by object name
     - by RA/DEC coords
     when this is done state goes to HOLD,  telescope az/el is frozen
  - selecy state:  TRACKING  or  HOLDING
  - other controls tbd
- display 
  . current telescope AZ/EL and RA/DEC
  . state now is TRACK or HOLD

Camera Pane
- camera image
- rotated and flipped to match AZ/EL sky chart 
- controls to pan and zoom

Misc
- print screen
- display date and time somewhere

Source code files:
- main.c:  main program flow;  mostly invoke routines in other files
- sky.c:  init() reads database files and gets planet locations
          sky_display()
- util.c ...

MOTOR DRIVE RATE
==================================

https://www.pololu.com/product/3134
MICROSTEP 1/32  of 1.8 degrees   = .056 degrees

From Pololu web site
- Maximum stepper speed: 50,000 steps per second
- Very slow speeds down to 1 step every 200 seconds 
  (or 1 step every 1428 seconds with reduced resolution).

FOR example belt is 6 to 1
  shaft speed .01 degrees per microstep
  need max of 15 degree / hour = .004 degrees per second
     
   .004 deg/sec  /  .01 deg/microstep  =   0.4 microstep / sec
                                           2.5 second / microstep

TELSECOPE INFO
==================================

Focal Len apprxo 45"  =  1140 mm

Lense = 12.5 mm

Mag = 1140 / 12.5 =  90   <===============

F number = 45" / 4.25"   ~=  10

Lense barrel diameter 1 1/4 "

But there's also a minimum magnification beyond which light emerging from the 
telescope eyepiece will spill around the dilated pupil of the eye and be wasted. 
The largest-focal-length eyepiece you can use with your telescope is easy to 
calculate: multiply the focal ratio (the focal length of your scope divided by 
its aperture) by 7. For example, your Newtonian scope is f/5: the largest-focal-
length eyepiece you should use is 35 mm. (Note: there is no harm in using a 
lower-power eyepiece — you will still be seeing the brightest possible view — 
but you will not be using all the light-collecting ability of the telescope's objective.)

Longest lense focal length = Fnum x 7 = 10 x 7  = 70 mm

Saturn's rings should be visible in even the smallest telescope at a 
magnification of 25 times. A good 3-inch scope at 50x magnification 
will show the rings as distinctly separate from the ball of the planet.

Crab Pulsar:
  The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically. 
  The optical pulsar is roughly 20 kilometres (12 mi) in diameter and 
  the pulsar "beams" rotate once every 33 milliseconds, or 30 times 
  each second
     Right ascension	05h 34m 31.97s
     Declination	+22° 00' 52.1"
     Apparent magnitude (V)	16.5

Magnitude 10 comets are common.
