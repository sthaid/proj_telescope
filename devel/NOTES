software
- xxx issues in software
- improve telescope positioning limits s/w

make list of hardware to buy at lowes
- longer screw for balancing, so nut can be used to hold it in place, instead 
  the large knob, and put this in a smaller piece of wood
- hardware to hold the scope in place when moving
  - use eye hooks and a dowel
  - check what I have
- do I have wood for a ramp already?

disassemble in preparation for wheels

lighten up balancing board, so more weight can be used to do the balncing

confirm bearing by using angle of sunrise, cast a shadow on graph paper, and
  draw compass on graph paper; need a veritical to cast the shadow, 

-------------

how to move telescope
- wheels
  - retractale levelling casters
  - ordered
- lock the telescope in place

buy new lens
- ordered 23 mm   
- mag shold be 1140 / 23 = 50x
- mag to see Saturn x50

install new lens, I hope it works without needing to modify the lens position

install siter scope, LATER after lense and other work on platform

telescope orientation practice, in living room
- re-level
- orient telescope leg 1 to TRUE north     MB=14
- image on neighbors barn, and calibrate

recalc the azimuth of deck view and run vp again

how well is the telescope balanced with the new lenses;
 perhaps can temporarily add weight to front, or remove from rear

if wheels are used will need a ramp

MAGNETIC DEBIATION
==================================

http://www.magnetic-declination.com/USA/Boston/2816856.html

Bolton Mass:  MD = -14 deg 22 min  = -14.36

TB = MB + MD     TrueBearing = MagneticBearing + MagneticDeviation

MB = TB - MD     MagneticBearing = TrueBearing - MagneticDeviation

In Bolton
    MagneticBearing = TrueBearing - MagneticDeviation
              14    =     0       -      (-14)

MOTOR DRIVE RATE
==================================

- MICROSTEP 1/32  of 1.8 degrees   = .056 degrees

From Pololu web site
- Maximum stepper speed: 50,000 steps per second
- Very slow speeds down to 1 step every 200 seconds 
  (or 1 step every 1428 seconds with reduced resolution).

FOR example belt is 6 to 1
  shaft speed .01 degrees per microstep
  need max of 15 degree / hour = .004 degrees per second
     
   .004 deg/sec  /  .01 deg/microstep  =   0.4 microstep / sec
                                           2.5 second / microstep

==================================
MY OLD TELSECOPE INFO
==================================

Focal Len apprxo 45"  =  1140 mm

Lense = 12.5 mm

Mag = 1140 / 12.5 =  90   <===============

F number = 45" / 4.25"   ~=  10

Lense barrel diameter 1 1/4 "

But there's also a minimum magnification beyond which light emerging from the 
telescope eyepiece will spill around the dilated pupil of the eye and be wasted. 
The largest-focal-length eyepiece you can use with your telescope is easy to 
calculate: multiply the focal ratio (the focal length of your scope divided by 
its aperture) by 7. For example, your Newtonian scope is f/5: the largest-focal-
length eyepiece you should use is 35 mm. (Note: there is no harm in using a 
lower-power eyepiece — you will still be seeing the brightest possible view — 
but you will not be using all the light-collecting ability of the telescope's objective.)

Longest lense focal length = Fnum x 7 = 10 x 7  = 70 mm

Saturn's rings should be visible in even the smallest telescope at a 
magnification of 25 times. A good 3-inch scope at 50x magnification 
will show the rings as distinctly separate from the ball of the planet.

  the pulsar "beams" rotate once every 33 milliseconds, or 30 times 
  each second
     Right ascension	05h 34m 31.97s
     Declination	+22° 00' 52.1"
